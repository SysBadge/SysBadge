                    To start using your Sysbadge, follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect your badge display unit to your PC's USB port.</li>
                    <li>On the back of the display, locate the <strong>{boot}</strong> and <strong>{rst}</strong> buttons.</li>
                    <li>Press and hold <strong>{boot}</strong> for 3 seconds, then press <strong>{rst}</strong> while still holding <strong>{boot}</strong>.</li>
                    <li>This will connect the display as a USB stick to your PC for file transfer.</li>
                    <li>Download the firmware UF2 file from <a href="https://cyberchaos.dev/kloenk/sysbadge/-/packages" class="underline">this link</a> and copy it to your display.</li>
                    <li>The badge will automatically disconnect from the PC. Reconnect it by following the same steps as above.</li>
                    <li>Visit <a href="https://pluralkit.me/" class="underline">PluralKit</a> to obtain your system ID.</li>
                    <li>Enter your system ID on <a href="/" class="underline">this page</a> to get the data file, and copy it to your badge display.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After completing these steps, you can disconnect any power sources if connected.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> A power source is required for using your Sysbadge.</p>

                <p>
                    When powered on, the badge should display your system name. Press <strong>B</strong> for software and support information.
                    Press <strong>B</strong> again to return to your system name, and use <strong>C</strong> to access the Name list.
                    To edit a name, select the cell by pressing <strong>B</strong>, which will highlight it, and then use the up or down buttons to edit.
                    You can display multiple people by pressing <strong>C</strong> again to show 2, 3, or 4 cells, and select the cell to edit with <strong>B</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If there's no activity for 30 seconds (configurable during build), the badge will enter sleep mode to save energy.
                    It will return to the starting screen when it wakes up, as it can't save its state.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Optional:</strong></p>
                <p>For added protection, you can find a 3D printable case <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/167251-badger-2040-enclosure/files" class="underline">here</a>. Assemble it using 2.5x 10mm screws or glue.</p>
                <p>Compatible power sources include power banks and USB-C to USB-C cables.</p>
