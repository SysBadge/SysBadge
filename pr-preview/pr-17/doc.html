                <p>
                    To get started with your Sysbadge, follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect your badge display unit to your PC's USB port.</li>
                    <li>Locate the <strong>{boot}</strong> and <strong>{rst}</strong> buttons on the back of the display.</li>
                    <li>Press and hold <strong>{boot}</strong> for 3 seconds, then press <strong>{rst}</strong> while holding <strong>{boot}</strong>.</li>
                    <li>This will connect the display to your PC, allowing file transfer.</li>
                    <li>Download the firmware UF2 file from <a href="sysbadge.uf2" class="underline">this link</a> and copy it to your display.</li>
                    <li>The badge will disconnect from the PC. Reconnect it by following the same steps.</li>
                    <li>Visit <a href="https://pluralkit.me/" class="underline">PluralKit</a> to obtain your system ID.</li>
                    <li>Enter your system ID on <a href="/" class="underline">this page</a> to get the data file, and copy it to your badge display.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Once completed, you can disconnect any connected power sources.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> A power source is required to use your Sysbadge.</p>

                <p>
                    When powered on, the badge should display your system name. Press <strong>B</strong> for software and support information.
                    Press <strong>B</strong> again to return to your system name, and use <strong>C</strong> to access the Name list.
                    To edit a name, select the cell by pressing <strong>B</strong>, which will highlight it, and then use the up or down buttons to edit.
                    You can display multiple people by pressing <strong>C</strong> again to show 2, 3, or 4 cells, and select the cell to edit with <strong>B</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If there's no activity for 30 seconds (configurable during build), the badge will enter sleep mode to save energy.
                    It will return to the starting screen when it wakes up, as it can't save its state.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Optional:</strong></p>
                <p>For added protection, you can find a 3D printable case <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/167251-badger-2040-enclosure/files" class="underline">here</a>. Assemble it using 2.5x 10mm screws or glue.</p>
                <p>Compatible power sources include power banks and USB-C to USB-C cables.</p>
